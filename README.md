## Designs
Each folder contains the designs in png-format. One filename contains 'outline' and includes the same design but with a white outline and a grey background. So in case you want to print it directly in its original shape select this file and change the gray tone to a transparent background.

The end of the figure as well as the lips look like pink-rose slime is dripping from it. Around the whole drawing is a white outline so the sticker stands out in front of the grey background." width="200">
